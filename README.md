# MinifiedUber-Backend

##In the project directory, you can run:

1.	Restore node_modules.
2. 	Run 'nodemon index' to start the backend service.
3. 	Add Your Mongo URL in index.js to connect to mongoDB

## Assumptions and Improvement
1. We can use update (put/patch) to change availability.
2. We can use BFS to show the closest drivers near the customer.
